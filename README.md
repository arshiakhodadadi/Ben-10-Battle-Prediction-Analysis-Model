# Ben-10-Battle-Prediction-Analysis-Model
I developed a machine learning model that predicts the outcomes of battles between Ben 10 aliens. By analyzing attributes such as strength, speed, and special abilities, the model forecasts the likely winner in various combat scenarios. This tool is designed for fans and researchers interested in exploring battle dynamics within the Ben 10 universe
